				<h2 class="scroll-animate">Case Study: Virtual Credit Card Numbers</h2>
				<p class="scroll-animate">In fighting credit card fraud, companies have come up with a variety of security measures and features to prevent us from being targeted easily. One of the ways is to have a virtual number when shopping online. It has been touted as impossible to steal from. So how does it work? The bank generates a string of random numbers which will be your virtual credit card number. The user has the option of setting a maximum charge amount, whereby the card will be deactivated once the charge amount exceeded the maximum charge amount. While this idea might deter potential fraudsters from stealing the usersâ€™ information, there are still some problems which comes with it.</p>
				<p class="scroll-animate">Because of the virtual nature of the card, sometimes it can be a nuisance when asked to present the card in real life. An example of this would be checking into a hotel with a reservation. Sometimes, hotel policy requires that the guest pay with the same card he booked the hotel with. If one made a reservation using his virtual credit card, he would not be able to pay up, making it a nuisance to sort it out with the management.</p>
				<p class="scroll-animate">The virtual credit card numbers also do not solve real life issues. While chances of being hacked online may decrease when using this service, users still need to use their real credit cards when paying for things in real life. As the service does not cover real life scenarios, the user will still be equally affected by fraudsters.</p>

				<h2 class="scroll-animate">Literature Review: Card Fraud by Howard Mizes</h2>
				<p class="scroll-animate">In December 3, 2013, Howard Mizes from Xerox said that there was little quantitative info of the card fraud algorithms shared publicly regarding the issue aforementioned, with less than 100 related academic studies done. It is evident that fraud detection studies are very challenging due to little data associated with fraud events, the fluctuating fraud behaviour, highly skewed datasets, etc. To show how much of a problem card fraud is, 32 percent of consumers reported card fraud in the past five years, according to a 2010 survey ACI Worldwide. Adding on to that is the fact that $5.55 billion credit card fraud worldwide in 2012 (U.S. Department of Justice), $3.56 billion in US (2011 Nilson Report).</p>
				<p class="scroll-animate">He also mentioned that fraud is only a small percentage of transactions, which means that obtaining a high recall might entail very low precision. This is displayed when Sam Maes, et al. (2002) found in his study that, by running a standard machine learning algorithm on 100 million credit card transactions with 10 thousand frauds inside, it gives us 6 million false positives after only detecting half the total number of frauds (5000).</p>

				<h2 class="scroll-animate">Literature Review: Behavior based credit card fraud detection using Support Vector Machines by V. Dheepa and R. Dhanapal</h2>
				<p class="scroll-animate">In 2012, V. Dheepa and R. Dhanapal conducted an investigation into utilising Support Vector Machines, a machine learning algorithm, for the detection of credit card fraud. After verifying the dataset, they determined that the datasets typically used in credit card fraud detection are typically extremely skewed, making accurate detection much more difficult. In addition to that, datasets are usually massive, so a scalable machine learning process must be used to accurately. Due to these, misclassification costs are relatively high. To combat all these problems, the duo utilised a behavioural based model and Support Vector Machine, which is commonly used for pattern recognition and classification, and is well suited for binary classification (fraudulent or non-fraudulent). They found that behaviour based classification utilising SVM gives effective performance with lower error rates.</p>
