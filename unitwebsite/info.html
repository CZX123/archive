					<div class="carousel-image image1">
						<h3>A Unified Image</h3>
						<p>During this explosive period of Singapore's history, our society was fraught with problems of law and order. There
							was high tension and mounting hatred between the community and the Police Force. Youths were the main targets as riots
							and unlawful activities slowly took a stronghold of our society. Actions needed to be taken immediately to rout potential
							safety and security threats that were impacting the community.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>Police Cadet Corps (PCC) was set up with the aim to break the barrier between the people and the Police Force and to
							instill a greater sense of discipline in youth and a sense of civic responsibility in them, thereby developing their
							moral character. The first PCC unit started only with 30 cadets and a single teacher officer - Mr. Victor Seah.</p>
						<div class="year">1959</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>This successful initiative inspired the formation of more units in schools around Singapore. 30 teachers were selected
							from different schools to be trained as PCC officers at the Police Training School (PTS). This year also marked the
							enactment of the Police Cadet Corps Ordinance in Parliament.</p>
						<div class="year">1961</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>As time passed, the movement started to gain recognition as a credible uniform youth organisation. The Corps was invited
							to participate in the 1963 State Day Parade.</p>
						<div class="year">1963</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>Formation of the first girl units in Raffles Girls' Secondary School and Sang Nila Utama Malay Secondary School took
							place. As PCC expanded, interesting programmes such as drill competitions, revolver shoots and visits to Police Stations
							and other police establishments were introduced to inject interest, boost quality and broaden experience of cadets.
							PCC also began to support the Police in the fight against crime and prepare youths for National Service (NS).</p>
						<div class="year">1964</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The first PCC Annual Parade was held and has since become a tradition from then on.</p>
						<div class="year">1966</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>PCC broke away from the command of Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) and became a fully independent unit. PCC then
							moved into its own Headquarters at Building No.4 at the PTS. The first independent PCC Commandant then was DSP Niaz
							Mohd Shah who played an important role in the strengthening of the foundation of the Corps and its expansion.</p>
						<div class="year">1967</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The concept of allowing units to design their formation sign was introduced. It enabled units to develop its own unique
							identity and instill a greater sense of pride and a sense of belonging among cadets.</p>
						<div class="year">1968</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-image image2">
						<h3>Marching Forward</h3>
						<p>The beginning of 1969 saw the arm, sea, air and police cadet movements coming under a common structure with Police
							taking on the title of National Cadet Corps (Police). It was a decade of expansion as the Corps grew at an extraordinary
							pace.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The demand for qualified teachers to train the growing number of cadets increased at an alarming rate and this eventually
							brought about the establishment of the Cadet Inspectors' (CIs) Unit, serving to develop young cadet leaders as potential
							future leaders of our nation. A CI is the highest rank attainable by an NPCC Cadet.</p>
						<div class="year">1970</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The Corps was officially renamed the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC). In the same year, NPCC Band made up of boys
							from various different secondary schools and vocational institutes was formed. They performed at NPCC functions such
							as Annual Parade and Service Day.</p>
						<div class="year">1971</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>NPCC also took on a new look when the NPCC uniform was changed from dark grey and khaki to blue, to match the uniform
							of the Singapore Police Force (SPF). However, to differentiate between the two, NPCC subsequently changed to a yellow
							lanyard and wore NPCC badges on their shirt collars. It was replaced again by the chain and whistle, in line with
							the regular police.</p>
						<div class="year">1972</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The first Overseas tour was introduced with the aim to broaden the cadets' mental outlook and portray the image of
							Singapore's NPCC.</p>
						<div class="year">1973</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The inaugural issue of the NPCC magazine, titled "The Police Cadet" was produced. The magazine aimed to keep cadets
							informed of the developments and achievements in the Corps. It also aimed to serve as a platform for exchange of ideas
							and information across units.</p>
						<div class="year">1974</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The NPCC Council was inaugurated. The Council was represented by personnel from the Ministry of Education and officers
							from the SPF, who would be responsible for policy development and overseeing the development of NPCC. With the formation
							of the NPCC Council gave the Corps greater sense of direction and purpose for the movement in the years ahead.</p>
						<div class="year">1975</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The introduction of swimming and kayaking as part of the NPCC activities, life-saving course was added to the training
							regime to enable students to perform lifeguard duties during camp.</p>
						<div class="year">1975</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>Community Involvement was launched in full scale with the objective to imbue in cadets an awareness of their citizen
							responsibility towards the welfare and security of our nation.</p>
						<div class="year">1978</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-image image3">
						<h3>Together, Standing Strong</h3>
						<p>In this decade, NPCC continued to spread its wings and attained a stronger identity and sense of belonging.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>NPCC marked its 20th Anniversary with a Cultural Night at the National Theatre. That year also saw the introduction
							of Service Medals to recognise officers for their dedication and service to the Corps.</p>
						<div class="year">1979</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>Proficiency badges were introduced. It aimed at instilling in cadets the desire to do well, to show recognition for
							their achievements, to encourage them to participate in healthy activities and sustain interest in the Corps.</p>
						<div class="year">1981</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The Best Unit Cadet award was also introduced in the same year.</p>
						<div class="year">1981</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The NPCC Unit in the National University of Singapore was officially established following the idea mooted by Council
							Chairman Dr Lawrence Chia in 1981.</p>
						<div class="year">1982</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The Crime Prevention Proficiency Badge was introduced with the aim to enchance awareness of crime prevention and to
							translate that knowledge into application and skills.</p>
						<div class="year">1982</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<p>The introduction of the NPCC Pledge and March took place. Both the NPCC Pledge and the NPCC March speaks the loyalty
							and dedication to the nation and the Corps. The Corps had forged a more distinct identity by then.</p>
						<div class="year">1983 - 1984</div>
					</div>
